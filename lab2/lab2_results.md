1. Zero-Shot and Few-Shot:

    -When would you choose zero-shot?
        zero-shot is useful if the information you are seeking is general, you do not care about format (a less structured response), using examples would not reasonable, or you do not want to go through the effort of providing examples.
    -When is few-shot worth the extra effort?
        When you want a standardized output; which follows a specific style. 
    -How did the classification output change from Task 3.11 Task 3.12
        It was pretty close execpt the spam which we could malipulate
    -How did the generated code change from Task 3.21 to Task 3.22?
        The code became less concise and more verbose in that 3.22 included documentation and more variation, while 3.21 stuck to clean 1 line solutions like the examples.
