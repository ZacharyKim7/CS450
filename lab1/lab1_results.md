# Questions:

1. Creative parameter: Brainstorming project ideas and exploring the potential tech stacks requires a large degree of creativity.

2. Creative parameter: No two projects are identical, and we would want our design to be well fit for our particular circumstances and requirements.

3. Consistent parameter: Code should follow standard practices and methodology to make easily readible and maintainable code. However, later on, there is an argument for creative parameters to help solve more unique or obscure issues.

4. Creative parameters: testing and QA aims to test as many possible code usecases in a wide range, especially cases that might be overlooked (eg. edgecases), though consistent parameters would be useful for adhering to standard testing practices.

5. Consistent parameters: we value predictable and stable results free of unexpected behavior.
